While <code>ROS2</code> frameworks like <code>MoveIt</code> offer comprehensive motion planning capabilities, they are often unnecessarily complex for tasks requiring simple, real-time pose or joint servoing.</p> <p>We present a set of lightweight, torque-based Cartesian and joint-space controllers implemented in C++ for <code>ros2_control</code>, compatible with any robot exposing an effort interface\u2014a common standard among modern manipulators. Our controllers incorporate friction compensation, joint limit avoidance, and error clipping, and have been validated on the Franka Robotics FR3 manipulator.</p> <p>Designed for fast integration and real-time control, our implementation lowers the barrier to deploying learning-based algorithms on <code>ROS2</code>-compatible platforms.
